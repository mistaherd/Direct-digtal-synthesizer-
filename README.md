## DDS Basics
- Direct digital synthesis (DDS) is a method of producing an analog waveformâ€”usually a sine wave
- by generating a time-varying signal in digital form and then performing a digital-to-analog conversion. Because operations within a DDS device are primarily digital, it can offer fast switching between output frequencies, fine frequency resolution, and operation over a broad spectrum of frequencies.
